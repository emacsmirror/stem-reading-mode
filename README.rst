bionic-reading-mode.el: Speed reading minor mode
================================================

Highlight word stems in text buffers, thereby providing artificial
fixation points to improve speed reading. Inspired by a website of the
same name.

Use ``M-x bionic-reading-mode`` in a text buffer to turn on (or off) the
minor mode. Customize ``bionic-reading-highlight-face`` to modify the
default highlight. Set ``bionic-reading-overlay`` to add the highlight
;; to existing previously-highlighted words.
