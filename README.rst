stem-reading-mode.el: Highlight word stems for speed-reading
============================================================

Highlight word stems in text buffers, thereby providing artificial
fixation points to improve speed reading.

Use ``M-x stem-reading-mode`` in a text buffer to turn on (or off) the
minor mode. Customize ``stem-reading-highlight-face`` to modify the
default highlight. Set ``stem-reading-overlay`` to add the highlight
to all words unconditionally.

With some modes, instead of highlighting the word stem, it might be
convenient to de-light the remaining part of a word instead. You can
achieve this effect by customizing ``stem-reading-delight-face``.

On Hi-Dpi displays (and a good font), a configuration similar to the
following can give excellent results:

.. code:: elisp

  (require 'stem-reading-mode)
  (set-face-attribute 'stem-reading-highlight-face nil :weight 'unspecified)
  (set-face-attribute 'stem-reading-delight-face nil :weight 'light)
